**Project Introduction & Objective:** Our goal is to evaluate the Boston government sector to understand the impact of the global pandemic, COVID-19, on the employees’ earnings for public sector.
The main topics that we will focus on covering are the followings:

* Pandemic Impact Analysis: Examine data across the years before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on earnings and workforce dynamics in the public sector. This includes changes in employment numbers, salary adjustments, and variations in overtime or bonus distributions.
* Earnings and Position Analysis: Investigate which job levels or positions recorded the highest earnings and determine which department saw the highest fluctuation in employee numbers during the pandemic. This analysis will help identify the roles and departments most impacted by the pandemic.
* Income Component Assessment: Analyze various components of employee income (such as base pay, overtime, bonuses, etc.) to determine which has the most significant impact on an employee’s gross earnings, especially during the pandemic period.
* Geographic Pattern Analysis: Construct and analyze patterns from data collected across various Boston areas/zip codes to understand if the pandemic’s impact on earnings varied geographically within Boston Area.

**Motivation:** Understanding the Boston Government's resource allocation is crucial for businesses and professionals, influencing economic development and fostering collaboration between the private and public sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in 2020, profoundly changed people’s lives and economies globally, resulting in many job losses and a transition to remote learning. In the meantime, industries continue to face a slow rebound. We aim to delve into the public sector within the Boston area to identify any significant change in employment structure, offering crucial insights for those eyeing careers in public sector after graduation. 

We will also analyze the public sector’s reaction to the pandemic, offering a critical perspective on the resilience of government employment reacting to global economic challenges. The intertwined relationship between public sector performance, consumer spending, and economic growth is also explored, offering businesses insights to tailor products and services specific for the public sector. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis goes beyond the implications of the pandemic and provides valuable information for companies and individuals whose economic activity is engaged in Boston's government sector.

**Data Source:** For the developement of this project we have used two datasets from two different sources.

1. Boston Government - Office of Human Resources: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report
  * The City of Boston releases an annual dataset containing payroll information for its employees, encompassing employee names, job details, and earnings breakdown, including base salary, overtime, and total compensation. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we are using the dataset spanning the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This resource, offers citizens valuable insights into the financial aspects of the City's workforce during these specific years.

2. United States Zip Codes - Massachusetts: https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ma/
  * This dataset provides zip code information for Massachusetts, including key details such as zip code, type, primary city, state, county, timezone, latitude, longitude among others. It offers a concise and comprehensive snapshot of geographic and locational attributes associated with each zip code in the state of Massachusetts. By incorporating this dataset, the project can be analyzed in a location-wise level.

**Report Summary:** This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on earnings within the Boston government sector, leveraging extensive datasets spanning data sourced from Boston Government’s payroll records for years 2018 to 2022 and Massachusetts zip code information. Specifically focusing on the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods, the project aims to uncover key trends and dynamics in the workforce, with a focus on objectives such as identifying top-earning job titles, evaluating departments with the highest employee numbers, and scrutinizing income components influencing gross earnings.

In terms of our payroll analysis results, we observed remarkable resilience and adaptability within the government job market over the last five years, showcasing the sector's rapid recovery post-COVID. Addressing the main objectives, our findings revealed anticipated yet noteworthy outcomes. Firstly, roles such as Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and Police Detectives emerged as top earners. Furthermore, the Boston Police Department dominated job offerings, constituting approximately 14% of all government jobs in Boston. Finally, our examination highlighted that regular and overtime income constitute the primary components of annual earnings for the Boston Police Department, accounting for 58% and 19%, respectively.
